MOBILE FIRST IN THIS PROJECT
============================

What "mobile first" means
-------------------------
We write CSS for the smallest screen first (phone). Then we add media queries
for bigger screens (tablet, desktop). So:

  - Default styles = mobile (one column, normal scroll, compact padding).
  - @media (min-width: 768px) { ... } = tablet and up (e.g. horizontal scroll, nav in a row).

We do NOT start with desktop and then try to shrink it. That way mobile stays
simple and fast, and we only add layout for bigger screens when we need it.


Where we use it in this project
-------------------------------

1. Header (Header.svelte)
   - Mobile: nav is hidden, only logo + menu button (hamburger). Tap to open nav.
   - 768px and up: nav shows in a row, menu button hides. Theme toggle always in header row.

2. Home page (+page.svelte)
   - Mobile: hero is one column, centered. Horizontal scroll section is just
     normal vertical scroll (cards stack). Theme toggle is in the header (not floating).
   - 768px and up: horizontal scroll section uses GSAP to fake horizontal scroll
     (pin + move). Cards sit side by side.

3. Hero section
   - Mobile: padding 28vh 1rem, single column.
   - 768px and up: more padding (25vh, extra-large left/right).

4. Horizontal scroll container
   - Mobile: overflow visible, cards stack.
   - 768px and up: overflow hidden, height 100vh, GSAP does the horizontal move.

5. Noscript message
   - Mobile: full width at bottom.
   - 768px and up: right side, max-width 20rem.


Breakpoint we use
-----------------
We use 768px as the breakpoint (min-width). So:
  - width < 768px  =>  mobile rules
  - width >= 768px  =>  tablet/desktop rules

You can change that in the @media (min-width: 768px) in +page.svelte and Header.svelte
if you want a different breakpoint.


Why mobile first
----------------
- Most users might be on phone first.
- Default = simple layout, less CSS, faster.
- We only add complex layout (horizontal scroll, big nav) when the screen is big enough.
- Easier to read: "base = mobile, then override for desktop" instead of
  "desktop first then fix mobile".
